# About

BinaryTreePathFinder is a small console application that searches the binary tree (triangle shaped) for the full paths from root to leaves and finds one which has the biggest sum of the node values. It prints out the total sum and the path (each node value)

# How do I use It?

Start the application and check the output in the console. It uses the default data stored in the const string in Data.cs. In order to use different values, modify the string.
